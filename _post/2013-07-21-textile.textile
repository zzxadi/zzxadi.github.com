h1. Textile Reference Manual for RedCloth 4
h2. Introduction
<p><b>Textile</b> is a simple text markup language to be used when writing on blogs, wikis, and documents.  This guide presumes no knowledge of <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, though you may certainly use it if what you want to accomplish is more complex than Textile allows.</p>
<p><strong>To get started learning Textile</strong>, click <a href="/textile/writing-paragraph-text/">Writing Paragraph Text</a> in the table of contents at the right. In each section of the manual, examples clearly illustrate the rules. In each example, the Textile example is followed by how the <span class="caps">HTML</span> appears in the browser.  If you&#8217;re familiar with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, check the <strong>Show <span class="caps">HTML</span> output</strong> box on each page to see the code produced by each Textile example.</p>
